Q1. Given the following statistics, what is the probability that a woman has cancer if she has a positive mammogram result?

    One percent of women over 50 have breast cancer.
    Ninety percent of women who have breast cancer test positive on mammograms.
    Eight percent of women will have false positives.

Q2. In a particular pain clinic, 10% of patients are prescribed narcotic pain killers. 
  Overall, five percent of the clinicâ€™s patients are addicted to narcotics (including pain killers and illegal substances). 
  Out of all the people prescribed pain pills, 8% are addicts. 
  If a patient is an addict, what is the probability that they will be prescribed pain pills?

Q3. A diagnostic test has a probabilit y0.95 of giving a positive result when applied to a person sufferingfrom a certain disease, 
    and a probabilit y0.10 of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. 
    It isestimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. 
    Suppose that the test is now administered to a person aboutwhom we have no relevant information relating to the disease 
    (apart from the fact that he/she comes from thispopulation). 
        Calculate the following probabilities:
          (a) that the test result will be positive;
          (b) that, given a positive result, the person is a sufferer;
          (c) that, given a negative result, the person is a non-sufferer;
          (d) that the person will be misclassified.
